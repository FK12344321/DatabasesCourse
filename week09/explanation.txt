After the 4th step the value of Alice's username is different
as we set the isolation level to "read uncommitted", so the
terminal 2 reads its updated state of the table, while the terminal 1
cannot see it, as the change is not committed.

After the commit, the value of the Alice's username is the same (consistent)
throughout the sessions

After the 8th operation the terminal 2 fails to update the balance because
it is already changed, but uncommitted.

Isolation levels:

Obviously, while reading with read committed isolation level, first terminal does
not print out the updates made by the second terminal because it was not committed yet.
At the same time, in repeatable read behaviour is the same. We still cannot read
uncommitted updates from another transactions.
